<h2><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>From deep learning to PageRank, iterative methods power many
magical-seeming uses of computers. By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method">iterative
method</a> we mean a
simple recipe to improve an approximate solution, which we apply
repeatedly starting from some initial value. While iterative methods
are not the bread and butter of CS courses or interview questions, in
many domains they are so much more scalable than alternatives they are
essentially the only game in town. This series is a tour behind the
curtain; this post introduces their implemention and some software
engineering considerations, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method">Conjugate
gradient</a>
(CG) method as our example.</p>
<p>What is CG for? to simulate physics (say, spread of heat) over a
complex shape, we break it up into a finite number of simple elements
in the Finite Element Method
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method">FEM</a>). The
implied relations between temperatures at different elements are
encoded into matrix $A$ that is positive definite (PD)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#PD">1</a></sup> and a vector
$b$, and to find the vector of temperatures $x$, it is enough to solve the
matrix equation \(Ax = b\), which CG can do well for PD matrices.</p>
<p>Implementing an iterative method often starts as a for loop around the
recipe, but that loop body accumulates cruft like you wouldn't believe
(<em>hmm, is it working? let's print an indication of progress...</em>). I'd
gotten used to writing these over and over and dreaming about better
design when I read a beautiful
<a href="https://lostella.github.io/2018/07/25/iterative-methods-done-right.html">post</a>
&quot;Iterative Methods Done Right&quot; (IMDR) by Lorenzo Stella. It proposes
to use a Julia iterable to abstract each iterative algorithm, and also
a reusable &quot;utility&quot; for each of those pesky recurring worries I
mentioned.</p>
<p>Could such a reusable vocabulary work for Rust as well? How far could
it go? Rust supports famously the creation of tight and efficient
abstractions that are difficult to misuse, and in particular supports
encoding loops into iterators, so it seemed worth a try. I decided to
follow in their footsteps, and essentially transcribed their design to
Rust, using <a href="https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray">ndarray</a> for the
numerical calculations. This is serving as the basis for a new library
for implementing and working with iterative methods. Our goal in this
post: to show how this design keeps the method itself nicely separated
from how it might be used.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#implementation-and-a-general-interface" id="implementation-and-a-general-interface">Implementation and a general interface</a></h2>
<p>To store the state our method maintains we define a struct
<code>CGIterable</code>, for which we implement the StreamingIterator trait. This
trait is simple, and requires us to implement two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>advance</code> applies one iteration of the algorithm via the code above</li>
<li><code>get</code> borrows <code>self</code> and return <code>Some(self)</code>. </li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit of the StreamingIterator trait over the ubiquitous
Iterator is <code>get</code> returning the struct by reference; this leaves
decisions to copy state up to the implementor.</p>
<p>The signatures for implementing an iterative method in this style are as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// The state of a conjugate gradient algorithm.
#[derive(Clone)]
struct CGIterable {
    // contents
}

impl CGIterable {
    /// Convert a LinearSystem problem into a StreamingIterator of conjugate gradient solutions.
    pub fn conjugate_gradient(problem: LinearSystem) -&gt; CGIterable {
	    // we chose to consume the LinearSystem, but it can probably be borrowed instead
    }
}

impl StreamingIterator for CGIterable {
    type Item = CGIterable;
    /// Implementation of conjugate gradient iteration
    fn advance(&amp;mut self) {
	    // the improvement recipe goes here
    }
    fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;Self::Item&gt; {
	    // We will eventually change this, but for now:
        Some(self)
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note a few design decisions in the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem representation  (here, LinearSystem) is distinct from that
of solution methods, of which there might be many.</li>
<li>The constructor method <code>conjugate_gradient</code> is responsible to set up
the initial state for the first iteration, and so is part of the
method definition. </li>
<li>Another constructor responsibility is to perform checks of the input
problem that are applicable and cheap: expensive initialization is a
bad fit for an iterative method.</li>
<li>We could set the <code>Item</code> type returned by the <code>get</code> method be only a
result field, thus hiding implementation details from
downstream. Perhaps unintuitively, this is a bad idea; minimal
abstractions with stable interfaces can be provided separately.</li>
<li>The same tradeoff exists in the set of fields defined in the struct,
as the following true story illustrates.</li>
</ul>
<p>My (almost) first implementation ended up looking like this<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#CG">2</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>        let ap = self.a.dot(&amp;self.p).into_shared();
        let alpha = self.rs / self.p.dot(&amp;ap);
        self.x += &amp;(alpha * &amp;self.p);
        self.r -= &amp;(alpha * &amp;ap);
        self.rsprev = self.rs;
        self.rs = self.r.dot(&amp;self.r);
        self.p = (&amp;self.r + &amp;(&amp;self.rs / self.rsprev * &amp;self.p)).into_shared();
        self.ap = Some(ap);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Having <code>ap</code> and <code>alpha</code> be temporaries and not fields of <code>CGIterable</code>
seemed like saving memory and hiding unnecessary detail, laudable
goals in principle. Soon after implementing this code I found myself
wanting to print them, which is impossible without modifying the
<code>advance</code> method!</p>
<p>Iterative methods are often highly sensitive beasts, with innocuous
seeming modifications causing sometimes subtle numerical and/or
dynamic effects that are very difficult to trade and resolve. Thus
avoiding modifications to the method implementation even when
attempting to study/debug it is a primary goal of this design. This is
served by storing more intermediate state in the iterable, and by
exposing all of it via <code>get</code>.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="CG"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Conjugate gradient algorithm</p>
</div>
<p>The implementation is very similar to the better explained Wikipedia

<h2><a class="header" href="#running-an-iterative-method" id="running-an-iterative-method">Running an iterative method</a></h2>
<p>How do we call such an implementation? the example below illustrates a
common workflow:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// First we generate a problem, which consists of the pair (A,b).
let p = make_3x3_pd_system();

// Next convert it into an iterator
let cg_iter = CGIterable::conjugate_gradient(p);

// and loop over intermediate solutions.
// Note `next` is provided by the StreamingIterator trait using
// `advance` then `get`.
while let Some(result) = cg_print_iter.next() {
	// We want to find x such that a.dot(x) = b
	// then the difference between the two sides (called the residual),
	// is a good measure of the error in a solution.
	let res = result.a.dot(&amp;result.x) - &amp;result.b;
	
	// The (squared) length of the residual is a cost, a number 
	// summarizing how bad a solution is. When working on iterative 
	// methods, we want to see these number decrease quickly.
	let res_squared_length = res.dot(&amp;res);
	
	// || ... ||_2^2 is notation for squared euclidean length of what 
	// lies between the vertical lines.
    println!(
        &quot;||Ax - b||_2^2 = {:.5}, for x = {:.4}&quot;,
        res_squared_length,
		result.x,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Indeed the output shows nice convergence, with the residual \(Ax -
b\) tending quickly to zero:</p>
<pre><code>||Ax - b||_2 = 1.00000, for x = [0.0000, 1.0000, 0.0000]
||Ax - b||_2 = 0.06250, for x = [-0.6250, 1.3125, -0.6250]
||Ax - b||_2 = 0.00391, for x = [-0.6641, 1.3320, -0.6641]
||Ax - b||_2 = 0.00024, for x = [-0.6665, 1.3333, -0.6665]
||Ax - b||_2 = 0.00002, for x = [-0.6667, 1.3333, -0.6667]
</code></pre>
<p>In terms of the code, notice the algorithm is taken out of the loop,
and so remains unsullied by such lowly practicalities as the progress
report dominating the loop body. Also the loop is currently infinite,
until we add stopping logic it won't stop on its own. Once we start
looking for such niceties, soon we'll want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at only every Nth iteration,</li>
<li>time the cost of an iteration (but not auxiliary I/O!), </li>
<li>plot progress over time,</li>
<li>save progress so we don't lose progress if electricity fails...</li>
</ul>
<p>and we certainly don't want all of those tangled in our loop. Such
functionality will be useful next time we write an iterative methods,
we'll want to reuse them! luckily, the idea of representing processes
with streaming iterator applies similarly to abstract those as well in
a way that is clean and orthogonal. We will demonstrate it in the next
post. Beyond design for code reuse, benchmarking and testing are two
additional core concerns, that look a little different for iterative
methods. How does one test the properties of code that doesn't really
want to stop, and for which solutions only approach correctness?</p>
<p>We'll get into those questions and more over the next few posts.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#reusable-utilities-for-iterative-methods" id="reusable-utilities-for-iterative-methods">Reusable utilities for iterative methods</a></h1>
<p>In our previous <a href="iterative_methods_part_1.html">post</a>, we introduced
iterative methods, implemented one (conjugate gradient) in Rust as a
StreamingIterator, and saw the cost of its solutions decrease towards
zero. The StreamingIterator interface allowed us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separate the
concern</a> of
implementing the method from those how it will be used. Today we will
dive deeper into the latter aspect of how iterative method
implementations are used, and in particular some common concerns that
can also be abstracted and reused.</p>
<p>That we bother to call some code an &quot;algorithm&quot; or &quot;method&quot; is usually
an indication that it is complex enough to deserve testing. This also
implies that it should be well abstracted, because it will have at
least two callers: the client(s) motivating its implementation, and a
test/benchmark that shows it returns a correct answer in the expected
time. What do these look like for iterative methods? the use of an
iterative method evolves in a specific sequence as it matures. We will
look at its lifecycle first, and implementation after.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#life-cycle-of-an-iterative-method" id="life-cycle-of-an-iterative-method">Life cycle of an iterative method</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#implementation" id="implementation">Implementation</a></h3>
<p>When we are initially implementing a method (most commonly,
decyphering and transcribing pseudocode from wikipedia or a paper),
the minimum sanity check we want to do is apply it to a simple problem
where we can tell whether it is making progress. Thus we will want to
print, for every iteration, the current solution (the problem is very
simple, so we can read it all) and its associated cost (the number
that should decrease).</p>
<p>An output like we saw last time:</p>
<pre><code>||Ax - b||_2 = 1.00000, for x = [0.0000, 1.0000, 0.0000]
||Ax - b||_2 = 0.06250, for x = [-0.6250, 1.3125, -0.6250]
||Ax - b||_2 = 0.00391, for x = [-0.6641, 1.3320, -0.6641]
||Ax - b||_2 = 0.00024, for x = [-0.6665, 1.3333, -0.6665]
||Ax - b||_2 = 0.00002, for x = [-0.6667, 1.3333, -0.6667] 
</code></pre>
<p>is enough for us to see progress. Lack of progress is often cause by
one of three common culprits (from obvious to less):</p>
<ul>
<li>we implemented the improvement step incorrectly,</li>
<li>to make progress the iterative method relies one some conditions
about the problem, which the chosen example does not fulfill. </li>
<li>we measure the cost incorrectly,</li>
</ul>
<p>while working to figure it out, we might print at every iteration also
the value of every field in the struct, and validate each calculation
independently. </p>
<p>Many iterative methods are very simple, straight line code with no
conditions, just a sequence of calculations. As such, the most common
failure mode in my experience is transcription bugs, such as
forgetting a <code>-</code> sign. These usually cause catastrophic failure to
progress, and are thus easy to detect. A handy trick is to keep your
implementation very close to the reference (order of operations,
variable names etc), then after transcribing compare them slowly and
carefully. This often suffices to find these errors.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#validation" id="validation">Validation</a></h3>
<p>Most iterative methods come with some theory that quantifies
progress. An example would be: $f(x_t) \le h(p)*f(x_0)/t$ where $f$ is
a cost function, $x_0$ is the initial solution, and $h$ is a function
of problem parameters such as dimension, condition number, smoothness,
etc. At a minimum validation should ensure that on a few non-trivial
problems fulfilling the methods assumptions, cost decreases over
iterations at a rate matching available theory. , but the
minimum above</p>
<p>A lot more can be done to validate iterative methods, and we will come
back to this in future posts.</p>
